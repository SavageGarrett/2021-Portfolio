Over the weekend, my dad came down to the Innovation Studio, and we laser cut this cool plaque for his friend's wedding. We tried out some new processes for developing laser-cuttable files. For this file, we hand drew what we wanted on a poster, cleaned it up in <https://pixlr.com>, then plugged it into the BOSS Laser software.
